drwxr-xr-x 1 student 197121 0 Jul 12 16:07 ./

        drwxr-xr-x 1 student 197121 0 Jul 12 16:14 ./
        drwxr-xr-x 1 student 197121 0 Jul 12 16:07 ../

7. ls -la  -checking directory contains
  output :

		drwxr-xr-x 1 student 197121 0 Jul 12 16:14 ./

		drwxr-xr-x 1 student 197121 0 Jul 12 16:14 .git/
8. make a text file in any editor .I am using Sublime and go the example_repo folder and create a file README.md
 here README should be all in CAPS LOCK .Here .md mean makeup file
after creating the README.md file ,your file will no see in  the github file .So check it using the command 
9. git status - this command will output:
  On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        README.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
--Means git will track any changes in the file but will no come in the github site.So we will need to commit the file
in the github site.Git will know any changes you made by using the command git status.
 So we will need to put the file in stagging so we type 
10. git add README.md  --nothing will output to run this command means this command will put the file in stagging
11. git status 
   
   On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   README.md
In order to put this put we need some message to know what will do this file .So we use -m "" ,here "" string means 
what this file will do write inside the double quotation
12. git commit -m "Initial commit"    -this will commit the file "README.md" in the reposity with message "Initial commit"
   Until now,this file is in our house need to ship in your desire location ie remote so we will ship to desired location
   using command 'git push origin master'  - push the file to desired location to see the file in remote github page 

13. git push origin master    - look the repository first path in the url and master means index.html etc. After running this command
       github will ask username/email and password to login in the github .After entered the username and password ,the file will be
      get in the github repository .
  -Whenever any file made change or creating file in our local computer will need to push by checking whether the file is push or not
 using command 'git status'
 14 suppose i made some changes in the README.md file but i dont want to commit in the github so check what is added by using command 
 15 git diff README.md
 output:
 		 diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
			index b82acd2..8884daa 100644
			--- a/README.md
			+++ b/README.md

note suppose i make some changes and push the file in the repository but due to changes pushed ,my website or code does not work .In this case we have to use git log and and take log hash and use the following command to return to the code previously work

17 . git checkout af35deaba2a484b97d8c918c44f9f30119  -see the hash in step 16 log

18. git checkout  master


 

19. some important command,run the below code it will see the beautiful changes done in the code
git log --topo-order --all --graph --date=local --pretty=format:'%C(green)%h%C(reset) %><(55,trunc)%s%C(red)%d%C(reset) %C(blue)[%an]%C(reset) %C(yellow)%ad%C(reset)%n'


I've been using this really cool git command for a long time called git lg. It's like git log but wayyyyyyyy better.

Here's the free code snippet, and what your .gitconfig file would look like when you add it to your global git config
