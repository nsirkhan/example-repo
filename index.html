8. make a text file in any editor .I am using Sublime and go the example_repo folder and create a file README.md
 here README should be all in CAPS LOCK .Here .md mean makeup file
after creating the README.md file ,your file will no see in  the github file .So check it using the command 
9. git status - this command will output:
  On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        README.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
--Means git will track any changes in the file but will no come in the github site.So we will need to commit the file
in the github site.Git will know any changes you made by using the command git status.
 So we will need to put the file in stagging so we type 
10. git add README.md  --nothing will output to run this command means this command will put the file in stagging
11. git status 
   
   On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   README.md
In order to put this put we need some message to know what will do this file .So we use -m "" ,here "" string means 
what this file will do write inside the double quotation
12. git commit -m "Initial commit"    -this will commit the file "README.md" in the reposity with message "Initial commit"
   Until now,this file is in our house need to ship in your desire location ie remote so we will ship to desired location
   using command 'git push origin master'  - push the file to desired location to see the file in remote github page 

13. git push origin master    - look the repository first path in the url and master means index.html etc. After running this command
       github will ask username/email and password to login in the github .After entered the username and password ,the file will be
      get in the github repository .
  -Whenever any file made change or creating file in our local computer will need to push by checking whether the file is push or not
 using command 'git status'
